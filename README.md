# Presentations

### :wave: Welcome to the repo for your project presentations

Please upload your project presentations, as well as notes/presentations from your tech spikes, in the folder corresponding to the current week :zap: 

If your presentation was made using HackMD, you can copy and paste the markdown straight into the new file. Otherwise drop a link for others to follow (Google Slides, Canva, etc) :sunglasses: 

If there is no folder for your current week, you are have honour of making it! :tada: 

### How do I make a new folder?

1. Click the `Create new file` button on top of the repo

3. Click `Commit changes` at the bottom - no need to fill in any commit messages or wait for approval

### What happens if I don't upload my presentations?

You will prompted on Discord for all eternity to do so :wink:

Be smart - upload on the day you write and present it!
